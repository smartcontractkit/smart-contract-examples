# Reserve-Backed Stablecoin Project

This repository contains a practical implementation of a reserve-backed stablecoin built with Foundry, designed to accompany a YouTube tutorial video.

ðŸŽ¬ **[Watch the full tutorial on YouTube](https://youtube.com/chainlink)**

## Project Overview

This stablecoin demonstrates key concepts of a reserve-backed cryptocurrency:

- **ERC20 Token**: Implements a standard ERC20 token with additional functionality
- **Reserve Backing**: The stablecoin is fully backed by reserves verified through a DataFeed (mocked in this example)
- **Minting Controls**: Only mint tokens when sufficient reserves exist
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for administrative actions
- **Safety Features**: Includes pause/unpause functionality and other safety measures

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Solidity and ERC20 tokens
- Familiarity with smart contract development

## Project Structure

- `src/StableCoin.sol`: The main stablecoin implementation
- `src/SmartDataMock.sol`: Mock price feed for testing
- `test/StableCoin.t.sol`: Comprehensive test suite
- `script/StableCoinInteraction.s.sol`: Deployment and interaction script

## Getting Started
